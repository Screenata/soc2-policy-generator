# SOC 2 Policy Generator

An AI agent skill that generates draft SOC 2 Type I/II policy documents for startups, with codebase scanning, cloud infrastructure scanning, SaaS tool integration, and automated GitHub Actions evidence collection.

## What It Does

- Generates **17 SOC 2 policies** covering all Trust Services Criteria
- Tailors policies to your company size, industry, and data types
- **Scans codebase** for security patterns and extracts concrete values (password lengths, bcrypt rounds, RBAC roles, session timeouts, TLS versions)
- **Scans cloud infrastructure** (AWS, GCP, Azure) for live configuration evidence
- **Scans SaaS tools** (Okta, Datadog, PagerDuty, Jira, etc.) via API for compliance evidence
- **Detects drift** between code, cloud, and SaaS configurations with cross-source comparison
- **Generates GitHub Actions workflows** for automated, recurring evidence collection
- **Auto-detects SaaS tools** from your codebase (env files, package managers, Terraform, CI configs)
- **Persists session state** across conversations so you can resume mid-workflow
- Includes evidence checklists with auditor sufficiency criteria
- Uses audit-safe language that under-claims to reduce risk

## Usage

Works with any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format:
- Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode
- Cursor / Windsurf
- Any agent supporting the skills format

Just say: "Generate SOC 2 policies"

## Workflow

1. **Gather context** — Resumes from `.compliance/config.json` if available; auto-detects SaaS tools from codebase; asks industry, company size, data types, cert type, org name
2. **Choose evidence collection** — Code + Cloud + SaaS, Code + Cloud, Code + SaaS, Code only, or Q&A only
3. **Select policy** — Pick from 17 available policies
4. **Answer questions** — Policy-specific questions asked one at a time
5. **Generate policy** — Full document with evidence tables and concrete values
6. **Save and review** — Approve, regenerate, or skip
7. **Generate workflows** — Optional GitHub Actions for automated evidence collection

## Policies Included

1. Governance & Board Oversight
2. Organizational Structure
3. Code of Conduct & Ethics
4. Information Security Policy
5. Incident Response
6. External Communications
7. Vendor Management
8. Risk Management

15. Business Continuity
16. Human Resources
17. Mobile & Endpoint

## Codebase Scanning

Extracts concrete values from your codebase — not just "auth exists" but "bcrypt uses 12 rounds":

| Policy | What It Extracts |
|--------|-----------------|
| Access Control | Password min length, bcrypt/argon2 config, RBAC roles, JWT expiry, session timeout, rate limits, account lockout |
| Data Management | Encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM), KMS keys, backup retention periods, log retention |
| Network Security | TLS versions, SSL policies, CORS origins, HSTS config, CSP directives |
| Change Management | Required reviewers, status checks, CI/CD stages, security scanning tools (Snyk/Trivy/CodeQL) |
| Vulnerability Monitoring | Scan schedules, severity thresholds, audit levels, Dependabot config |

## Cloud Infrastructure Scanning

Scans live AWS, GCP, and Azure environments using CLI tools (read-only commands only):

| Provider | What It Scans |
|----------|--------------|
| AWS | IAM password policy, MFA status, S3 encryption, RDS backups, KMS rotation, ALB TLS, security groups, WAF, ECR scanning, SecurityHub, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Backup plans |
| GCP | IAM policies, Cloud SQL backups, KMS keys, SSL policies, firewall rules, Cloud Armor, Security Command Center |
| Azure | Conditional access, RBAC assignments, storage encryption, SQL TDE, Key Vault, NSGs, App Gateway WAF, Defender assessments |

## SaaS Tool Integration

The agent generates API integrations on demand for your SaaS stack — no pre-built connectors needed:

| Category | Tools | SOC 2 Evidence |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Identity & Access | Okta, Auth0, Google Workspace, JumpCloud | MFA enrollment rates, password policies, admin roles, deprovisioned users |
| Monitoring & Alerting | Datadog, PagerDuty, New Relic, Splunk | Active monitors, escalation policies, on-call schedules, incident metrics |
| Project & Change Mgmt | Jira, Linear, GitHub | Change ticket metrics, branch protection, PR review stats, Dependabot alerts |
| HR & People | BambooHR, Gusto, Rippling | Employee counts, termination tracking, policy compliance |
| Endpoint Management | Jamf, Kandji, Intune | Managed device counts, encryption status, compliance policies |
| Security Scanning | Snyk, SonarCloud | Vulnerability counts by severity, quality gate status, monitored projects |

For tools not in the catalog, the agent uses its API knowledge to generate integrations on the fly, or asks for documentation.

## SaaS Auto-Detection

Before asking you to list your SaaS tools, the skill scans your codebase for signals:

| Signal Source | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| Env templates | `.env.example` with `OKTA_DOMAIN`, `DD_API_KEY` |
| Package managers | `@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs` in package.json, `dd-trace` in requirements.txt |
| Terraform | `provider "datadog"`, `provider "pagerduty"` in `*.tf` files |
| CI/CD | `snyk/actions`, `sonarsource/sonarcloud` in GitHub Actions |
| Config files | `newrelic.js`, `.snyk`, `sonar-project.properties` |
| Docker Compose | `datadog/agent` images |

Detected tools are presented for confirmation, not assumed. Falls back to manual selection if nothing is detected.

## Session Persistence

The skill tracks progress in the `.compliance/` folder (committed to your repo):

- **`.compliance/config.json`** — org name, policy owner, industry, company size, data types, cert type, evidence method
- **`.compliance/status.md`** — policies generated, SaaS tools configured, workflows created
- **`.compliance/answers/{policy}.md`** — per-policy Q&A answers (editable before generation)

If a session ends mid-way (e.g., you configured 3 of 6 SaaS tools), the next session picks up where you left off.

## Automated Evidence Collection

Pre-built scripts for 21 SaaS tools ship in `assets/scripts/`. The agent copies them, configures, tests locally, then wires into GitHub Actions workflows:

- **Copy-first approach** — pre-built scripts are copied and tested; generate-on-demand is the fallback if APIs have changed
- **Per-tool scripts** — each tool gets `{tool}.sh` + `{tool}.config.json` (atomic pair) in `.compliance/scripts/`
- **Code scanning** — Weekly + on every PR, outputs to `.compliance/evidence/code/`
- **Cloud scanning** — Weekly/monthly, outputs to `.compliance/evidence/cloud/`
- **SaaS scanning** — Weekly, outputs to `.compliance/evidence/saas/`
- **Cross-source comparison** — Compares code vs cloud vs SaaS for overlapping controls
- **Git audit trail** — Evidence files are committed with timestamps for audit history
