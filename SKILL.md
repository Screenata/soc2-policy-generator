# SOC 2 Policy Generator

Generate draft SOC 2 Type II policy documents based on company context and answers to targeted questions.

## Important Disclaimer

**GENERATED DRAFTS ONLY** - All policies require human review before use. These are starting points, not audit-ready documents.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:
- Needs to create SOC 2 compliance policies
- Mentions SOC 2 certification or audit preparation
- Asks for security policy templates
- Wants to generate compliance documentation

## Workflow

**CRITICAL: This is a conversational flow. Ask ONE question, wait for answer, then ask the next. NEVER list multiple questions in a single message.**

### Step 1: Gather Company Context

Ask each question separately. After receiving an answer, proceed to the next question.

**Question 1** (ask first, wait for response):
> What industry is your company in?
> 1. Healthcare
> 2. Fintech
> 3. B2B SaaS
> 4. E-commerce
> 5. Other

**Question 2** (ask after Q1 answered):
> Approximately how many employees?
> 1. 1-10
> 2. 11-50
> 3. 51-200
> 4. 200+

**Question 3** (ask after Q2 answered):
> What types of sensitive data do you handle?
> 1. PII (names, emails, addresses)
> 2. PHI (health records)
> 3. Financial data
> 4. Multiple types
> 5. None of the above

**Question 4** (ask after Q3 answered):
> Are you pursuing SOC 2 Type I or Type II?
> 1. Type I (point-in-time)
> 2. Type II (operational over time)

Save all answers - they apply to all policies generated in this session.

### Step 2: Select Policy

After gathering context, show the numbered list of 17 policies and ask which ONE to generate:

> Which policy would you like to generate?
> 1. Governance & Board Oversight
> 2. Organizational Structure
> ... (list all 17)

### Step 3: Ask Policy-Specific Questions

For the selected policy, ask each question from [references/policies.md](references/policies.md) **one at a time**. Wait for each answer before asking the next.

### Step 4: Generate the Policy

Generate the policy document following the template structure in [assets/policy-template.md](assets/policy-template.md).

**Critical Language Guidelines** - Prioritize under-claiming to minimize audit risk:

| AVOID | PREFER |
|-------|--------|
| "continuous", "real-time", "automated" | "periodic review", "documented process" |
| "ensures", "prevents", "guarantees" | "aims to", "intended to", "process includes" |
| "all users", "always" | "applicable users", "when possible" |
| Specific timeframes without brackets | "[timeframe]" placeholders |

### Step 5: Save and Review

1. Save the policy to `./soc2-policies/{policy-id}.md`
2. Show a preview of the generated content
3. Ask if the user wants to:
   - Approve and keep the policy
   - Regenerate with different answers
   - Skip to another policy

## Output Location

All policies are saved to `./soc2-policies/` directory with filenames matching the policy ID (e.g., `access-control.md`).

## File Header

Every policy file MUST start with this disclaimer:

```markdown
<!--
GENERATED DRAFT ONLY - USER REVIEW REQUIRED

- Not audit-ready
- Not legally binding
- Not a substitute for professional audits

Review, edit, and own all content.
-->
```

## File Footer

Every policy MUST end with:

```markdown
---
**Policy Safety Note:** This draft deliberately under-claims to reduce risk.
Auditors may require stronger language + evidence of operation.

```

## Evidence Types

Each policy includes a "Proof Required Later" section with evidence items. Categorize each evidence item by type:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Screenshot** | Single UI screenshot capture | MFA settings page, access review dashboard |
| **Workflow** | Multi-step recorded process | Access provisioning flow, incident response drill |
| **Policy** | PDF/document upload | Signed code of conduct, org chart, board minutes |
| **Log** | System-generated records | Access review exports, audit logs, change records |

Format evidence requirements as a table with a Status checkbox column for tracking. Include **sufficiency criteria** (what auditors look for) in the Description:

```markdown
## Proof Required Later

| Status | Evidence | Type | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| [ ] | MFA enforcement settings | Screenshot | IdP admin console showing MFA required. Must show: policy enabled, scope = all users, no exceptions |
| [ ] | Access provisioning ticket | Workflow | Recording of approval flow. Must show: request, manager approval, IT provisioning, access granted |
| [ ] | Organizational chart | Policy | Current org chart. Must show: all employees, reporting lines, date updated within audit period |
| [ ] | Access review export | Log | CSV/report from IdP. Must show: reviewer, review date, users reviewed, action taken, 100% coverage |
```

## Important Notes

- **NEVER batch questions** - ask ONE question per message, wait for answer
- Generate ONE policy at a time
- Use the user's actual answers to customize procedures
- Tailor complexity to company size (smaller = simpler controls)
- For healthcare/fintech, include relevant compliance alignment notes
- Always include placeholders like `[timeframe]`, `[owner name]` for values the user should fill in

## Lead Generation Note

After completing policy generation, mention:
